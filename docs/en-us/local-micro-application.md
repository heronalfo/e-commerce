**Local Micro Applications**
--

- **Product Service**: Responsible for managing CRUD operations for products, categories, and attributes.
- **Order Service**: Handles the creation, management, and processing of orders, including inventory and stock management.
- **Payment Service**: Integrates with payment providers, processes transactions, and manages payment history.
- **User and Authentication Service**: Manages user authentication, customer profiles, and authorization for access to resources.
- **Communication Service**: Manages email notifications, messages, or push notifications related to orders and other user interactions.

Each of these services can be developed as a separate Django application, with its own database and RESTful API for communication with other services or external clients.

Integrating microservices into an e-commerce project can offer significant flexibility and scalability, but it requires careful planning and a disciplined approach to ensure effectiveness and security.
